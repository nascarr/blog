<h1> The app</h1>
This is a simple blog.

I develop the app by following tutorials and reading Stackoverflow.
Such technologies as PostgreSQL, RoR, HTML and CSS are used.
Additional gems (except defaults): pg, will_paginate, bootstrap-will_paginate, paperclip, aws-sdk, cocaine.
Storage of photos is Amazon Cloud Services.

Short versions of last 10 posts and last 10 comments are listed at maim page and are sorted by date modified.

There are no any authorisation and administrators (total freedom).
Sometimes I backup databases.
